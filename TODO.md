TODO:
- priority scheduling
- this + networking - linearizability...
- browser + node compatibility
- decorators
- change unique id to some hashing algorithm
- pattern matching
- prefix matching
- wildcard matching
- set matching mode in subscribe call (default: exact)
- per channel schemas for message types - i.e. enforce validity
- persistent configurations
- queues per channel for deferred streams (i.e. grab events when they're ready)
- add topics within channels
- potentially deal with references vs copying messages (since all subscribers get a reference to the same object)
- track previous message sent to topic to determine if it should publish or not (publishOn)
- duplex communication
